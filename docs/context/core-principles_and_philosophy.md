## Philosophy
✅ RIGHT WAY > Quick way
✅ PRODUCTION QUALITY from day 1 (no prototypes that become tech debt)
✅ ACCESSIBILITY FIRST (vision-impaired, eye fatigue, all ages)
✅ FUTURE-FRIENDLY (scales, evolves, doesn't break)
✅ COLLABORATIVE (next developer understands immediately)
✅ SELF-HEALING (systems diagnose and fix themselves when possible)

## Code Quality Standards
Engineering vs Hacking:
├─ Architected: Clear boundaries, interfaces, contracts
├─ Documented: TSDoc + inline narrative (WHY, not just WHAT)
├─ Modular: Change one thing, nothing else breaks
├─ Tested: Unit + integration + E2E coverage
└─ Resilient: Graceful degradation, never crashes

Programming vs Scripting:
├─ Type-safe: TypeScript strict mode, branded types
├─ Predictable: Pure functions where possible
├─ Maintainable: 6 months later, you understand it
└─ Scalable: Works for 10 users AND 10 million

Robust vs Fragile:
├─ Error handling: Every failure path considered
├─ Logging: Actionable messages with context
├─ Recovery: Auto-heal when safe, alert when not
└─ Monitoring: Know it's broken before users do
