I have Figma desktop app open. Brand new file.

I want to:
1. Create color palette (from approved tokens)
2. Create typography styles
3. Set up component structure

Walk me through creating the color styles first.
My approved colors are in the context document.

What exactly do I click/do in Figma right now?
