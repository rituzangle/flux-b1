## Critical Verification Results

### 1. Onboarding Flow - INTACT ✅

**File Structure:**
```
app/
├── page.tsx                     ✅ Present (Simple home page)
└── onboarding/
    ├── layout.tsx              ✅ Present with dynamic export
    ├── page.tsx                ✅ Present (Charity selection)
    ├── amount/
    │   └── page.tsx            ✅ Present (Amount selection)
    └── success/
        └── page.tsx            ✅ Present (Success screen)
```

**Navigation Chain Verified:**
1. `/` (Home) → User can navigate to `/onboarding`
2. `/onboarding` → Continue button → `/onboarding/amount?charity={id}`
3. `/onboarding` → Skip button → `/` (back to home)
4. `/onboarding/amount` → Donate button → `/onboarding/success?txn={id}`
5. `/onboarding/amount` → Back link → `/onboarding`
6. `/onboarding/success` → Explore button → `/`

**All Navigation Functions Present:**
- ✅ `handleContinue()` in `/onboarding/page.tsx:42-46`
- ✅ `handleSkip()` in `/onboarding/page.tsx:48-51`
- ✅ `handleDonate()` in `/onboarding/amount/page.tsx:59-75`
- ✅ `handleExplore()` in `/onboarding/success/page.tsx:107-110`

### 2. Dynamic Export Configuration - CORRECT ✅

**Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`):**
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  ✅ Line 14
```

**Home Page (`app/page.tsx`):**
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  ✅ Line 7
```

**Onboarding Layout (`app/onboarding/layout.tsx`):**
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  ✅ Line 7

**Client Components:**
- Onboarding pages are properly marked with `'use client'`
