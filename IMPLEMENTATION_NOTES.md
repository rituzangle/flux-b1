- ✅ Screen reader labels
- ✅ Respects prefers-reduced-motion

## 🎯 Design Highlights

### Color Palette
- Background: #fafaf9 (warm off-white)
- Text: #0a0a0a (true black)
- Primary: #2563eb (blue)
- Success: #10b981 (green)
- Error: #ef4444 (red)

### Typography
- Body: 18px (comfortable reading)
- Line Height: 1.6 (reduced eye strain)
- Minimum: 16px (accessibility)

### Spacing
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum
- Generous padding: 16-24px
- Clear visual hierarchy

## 🔄 Flow Behavior

### First-Time User
1. Lands on `/onboarding` (auto-redirect if not completed)
2. Selects charity → continues to amount
3. Chooses amount → sees live impact preview
4. Donates → sees AI insights
5. Completes → redirects to dashboard

### Returning User
1. Lands on dashboard
2. Sees WW prompt if:
   - Has completed onboarding
   - In payday window (1-3rd or 15-17th)
   - Hasn't dismissed for current payday
3. First donation: Prominent card
4. Subsequent: Subtle button

## 🔌 API Integration Ready

All components use `@/utils/api.ts` for data access. To connect real APIs:

1. Set up backend endpoints
2. Update `.env.local` with API keys
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK=false`
4. Implement real API calls in `api.ts`

Example:
```typescript
export async function getCharities(): Promise<Charity[]> {
  if (USE_MOCK) {
    // Current mock implementation
  }
  // Add real API call here
  const res = await fetch('/api/charities');
  return res.json();
}
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Bottom navigation on mobile
- Sidebar navigation on desktop (md breakpoint)
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly targets throughout

## 🎨 Animation Details

### Implemented
- Count-up animation for impact numbers (500ms)
- Smooth page transitions (fade)
- Button hover effects (scale + shadow)
- Card selection animation (border + background)
- Loading states (pulse)

### Simple Confetti (Currently)
- Bounce animation on success screen
- 3-second display
- Can be enhanced with canvas-based confetti

## 🚀 Performance

Build stats:
- Total routes: 8
- First Load JS: ~102-109 kB
- All pages statically generated
- Fast page loads

## 🧪 Testing the App

### Test Onboarding Flow
1. Visit `/onboarding`
2. Select any charity
3. Choose amount ($10 recommended)
4. Complete donation
5. View AI insights
6. Click "Explore Flux"

### Test Payday Detection
The app uses mock data where you can manually test by:
1. Updating `mockUser.ts` settings
2. Changing `lastWWPromptShown` date
3. Observing prompt behavior on dashboard

Current date: October 13, 2025 → Not in payday window
To test: Mock data can be adjusted or wait until 15th
